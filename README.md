    - np.ones(): Creates an array filled with ones.
    - np.arange(): Creates an array with evenly spaced values.
    - np.linspace(): Creates an array with evenly spaced values over a specified range.
- Array indexing and slicing:
    - Accessing elements: arr[index]
    - Slicing: arr[start:stop:step]
3. Array Operations
- Arithmetic operations:
    - Addition: arr1 + arr2
    - Subtraction: arr1 - arr2
    - Multiplication: arr1 * arr2
    - Division: arr1 / arr2
- Broadcasting:
