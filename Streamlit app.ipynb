It allows you to connect various language models with your custom code, enabling you to create complex conversational AI systems that can understand, generate, and interact with human language.\n",

            "LangChain provides a set of building blocks, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Agents**: These are high-level interfaces for interacting with language models. They can handle complex tasks, such as processing user input, calling functions, and generating responses.\n",
            "2. **Chains**: Chains are sequences of calls to language models and/or other chains. They help you break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.\n",
            "3. **Tools**: Tools are functions that can be called by an agent to perform tasks. They can be custom Python functions or external APIs.\n",
            "4. **Memory**: LangChain provides several types of memory for storing and retrieving information during a conversation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's a simple example of how you can use LangChain to create a conversational AI system:\n",
